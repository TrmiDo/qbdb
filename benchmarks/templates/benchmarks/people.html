            <h1>Peter M. Kogge</h1>
            <p class="profilecomment">
                    Prof. Kogge’s research encompasses parallel processing architectures, advanced VLSI technology, non von Neumann models, and parallel algorithms. His recent focus is on "Processing-in-Memory" (PIM) architectures, integrating memory and logic on single VLSI chips, and scaling these to complete systems. This involves efficient parallel topologies, control strategies, and low-power CPU designs for applications ranging from deep-space exploration to petaflops-level supercomputing. Additionally, he explores how PIM concepts may apply to quantum cellular array logic, envisioning “Processing-in-Wire.”

                                Luke Braby, a Computer Science student and Stamps Scholar at the University of Notre Dame, has a robust background in software engineering and research. He interned at Volexity and Copia, developing Go programs for memory scanning and designing a memory pool scanner. At Copia, he also created a Go-based REST API and an ETL pipeline for delivery data. He improved system performance by caching AWS Cognito results in Redis and automated Sisense rebuilds with AWS Lambda.
