1,20,,DW_2000Q_6,minor miner,quantum annealing,,,0.25,,,500,annealing time,200,Number of Cuts Ratio (current/METIS),0.96,"Did not specify embedding method used, assumed default D-Wave embedding software.
Ratio to Classical Solution comes from figure 5 and is an eye estimate from the graphical results since exact numbers could not be found."
